#### **1. Objectives for the Week (from Prof.)**

1. Calculate <Npart> for each of the 10% centrality using the Table 1 from the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/nucl-ex/0105011
2. Determine the dphi distribution after background subtraction and fit subtraction for |eta| < 1;
3. Calculate the multiplicity by integrating the dphi peak, dividing by 2 (because |eta| < 1 is two units of rapidity) and dividing by the number of events; that gives dN/deta;
4. Plot dN/deta/<Npart/2> vs Npart for the 4 centrality bins.
